# Click Event

This function handles mouse events. It checks if the left button of the mouse is clicked and initializes the position of the circle and text. It then checks if the newly clicked point overlaps with any of the existing points. If it does, it offsets the position of the text for the new point by a fixed amount. It then appends the coordinates and ID of the click to the list of points and draws a circle at the clicked location. It also puts the ID number inside the circle and displays the image.

# Distance

This function calculates the Euclidean distance between two points.

# Load Image

This code loads the image using the path passed as an argument and creates a window to display the image.

# Mouse Callback

This code sets the mouse callback function for the window and initializes the ID number for the first click.

# Pandas DataFrame

This code creates a pandas DataFrame from the list of points and saves the DataFrame to a CSV file.

# Save Image

This code saves the image with all the circles as a new image with the same filename as the original image with the suffix "circled".

# Close Windows

This code closes all windows.

# Additional Functionality

There is no code present in the file to add light/weather data from the UC Davis weather stations for the final datasheet.
